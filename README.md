# Performative Prediction

This repository is duplicated from [Performative Prediction](https://github.com/zykls/performative-prediction). It originally contained experiments from 

* J. C. Perdomo*, T. Zrnic*, C. Mendler-DÃ¼nner, M.Hardt. [Performative Prediction](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/perdomo20a.html). ICML 2020.

We have updated it to add a new approach, RRM-Follow-the-Leader, also known as Running Subsample.

To run, please run credit_simulator.py and then visualize results in credit-simulator.ipynb.
